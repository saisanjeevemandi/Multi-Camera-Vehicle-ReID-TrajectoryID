# Results and Visualizations

This folder contains visual evidence of the model's performance:

- Detection outputs from both camera streams
- Frame processing time vs frame index
- Confusion matrix for detection performance

These results demonstrate real-time object detection, trajectory smoothing, and system efficiency.
